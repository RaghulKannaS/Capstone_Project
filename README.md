# TARGETING THE RIGHT CUSTOMERS USING CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS TO INCREASE REVENUE
# Business Problem:
•	There has been a revenue decline for the Portuguese bank and they would like to know what actions to take. After investigation, they found out that the root cause is that their clients are not depositing as frequently as before. Knowing that term deposits allow banks to hold onto a deposit for a specific amount of time, so banks can invest in higher gain financial products to make a profit. In addition, banks also hold better chance to persuade term deposit clients into buying other products such as funds or insurance to further increase their revenues. As a result, the Portuguese bank would like to identify existing clients that have higher chance to subscribe for a term deposit and focus marketing effort on such clients.
•	To resolve the problem, we suggest a classification approach to predict which clients are more likely to subscribe for term deposits.
# Objective:
•	The basic objective of the project is to analyze Tele-Marketing data collected from a Bank and predict whether the customer will subscribe the term deposit or not, also identify the driving factors behind this. This would inform the Bank’s decisions on which Customers to target for their Marketing Campaign, which would ultimately increase their Product Sales. Understanding their customers is critical for effectively executing their Marketing campaign.
